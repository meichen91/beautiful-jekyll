My name is Meichen. Welcome to my tech blog! I was trained as a Chemical Engineer. Had the chance to played with MRI machines during my PhD. Been through ups and downs, but luckily (about to) made it, with the help from so many! 

Although I only came across the subject, *[data driven dynamics]({{"2018-04-04-Data-driven-dynamics"| absolute_url }})*, towards the end of my PhD, I have found it something I really want to look into. To share something about this subject is why I started this blog. 

I love cooking, workout, play some violin, and read a bit.
