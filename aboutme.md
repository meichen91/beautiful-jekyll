My name is Meichen. Welcome to my tech blog! I am a newly minted data scientist, working in the competitive car insurance industry. I was trained as a Chemical Engineer and recently graduated from my PhD, filming water flow using  cool MRI machines. 

Towards the end of my PhD, I came across the subject of *[data driven dynamics]({{"2018-04-04-Data-driven-dynamics"| absolute_url }})*, which motivated me to started this blog. I have some experience with [compressed sensing techniques]({{"2018-04-01-Compressed-sensing-for-classification"| absolute_url }})) and was drawn to the data science by the fascinating machine learning. I hope to continue the exciting learning beyond my work, keeping up with this booming field!

I love cooking, workout, play some violin, and read a bit.
