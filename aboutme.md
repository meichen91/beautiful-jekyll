My name is Meichen. Welcome to my blog! I was trained as a Chemical Engineer. Had the chance to played with MRI machines during my PhD. Had ups and downs, but luckily made it through, with the help from so many. 

Although I only came across the subject towards the end of my PhD, I have found something I really want to look into. To share something about this subject is why I started this blog.

I love cooking. Play some violin and read a bit.
